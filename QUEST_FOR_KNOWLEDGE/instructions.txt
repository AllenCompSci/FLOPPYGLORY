1.  GETTING STARTED
	QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE is a fun, easy game to play.  To get started, you need to:
	1.  Insert floppy disk into your computer.
	2.  Open up "My Computer" and find your A: drive.
	3.  Open up your A: drive and find the file "GAME.EXE".
	4.  Prepare to play QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE.

2.  PLAYING THE GAME
	1.  To start with, decide what kind of questions you would like to use.
		MATH:  These questions come from various fields of math, from simple addition to 		               algebra and geometry
		HISTORY:  These questions are VERY hard, and concern dates and names
		MIXED:  These combine both math and history questions
	2.  After deciding which questions you want to use, decide how many people are playing (1-4) and 	     insert their names.  You can only put in ONE (1) NAME; NO SPACES please.
	3.  When the questions appear, type in the letter next to the correct answer.  If you are right, a dice 	will roll and you will move a certain number of spaces.  If you are wrong, you will not move.
	4.  The first person to the last space on the board wins!
