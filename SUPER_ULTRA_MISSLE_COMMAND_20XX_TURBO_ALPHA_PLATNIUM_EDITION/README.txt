Troubleshooting Q&A
Q: Why does a portion of the missile trail go away when an
explosion happens over it?
A: it is a missile trail. Like the trail a plane leaves in the
sky and another plane flys
through that it doesn't just come back.

Q: Then why does the line go away when the missile is destroyed?
A: If it didn't the screen would be a mess.

Q: Why does the turret turn the same as the ground on the second
level?
A: The turret is being upgraded after seeing the power of the
first attack.

Q: Why does the bases turn the same as the ground on the third
level?
A: the bases are being upgraded. and by the forth level they're
done.

Q: Then why dont you just upgrade both at the same time?
A: Upgrading cost money.

Q: Why does the game crash to the desktop sometimes after 
   restarting? 
A: Under certain circumstances, the combination of simultaneous 
   functions amalgamated with communist interference
   come into conflict and causes the program to crash. If the 
   game happens to crash during the game, simply
   reopen Game.exe and enjoy!
