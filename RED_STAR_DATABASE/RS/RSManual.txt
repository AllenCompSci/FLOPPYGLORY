
Welcome to the Red Star database. Everything a pilot of the RSA-Class fighter 
needs to know is contained in this location, and can be referred to at anytime.
RSA Class pilots run missions reserved for elite units, and these missions can be done in tandem with another pilot or on a solo run. 
The commands for controlling your RSA are listed below. 
(The 2nd Player's commands are in brackets.) 

Forward - Up (W)		Back - Down (S)
		
Left - Left (A)		Right - Right (D)

Fire - Spacebar (Left Shift)	Bomb - N (Z)

The RSA Class fighter is capable acquiring some weapons from destroyed opponents. 
These will be marked as various colored symbols on the display.

Red - Cannon	Blue - Laser	Purple - Arc


Keep in mind that every weapon you pick up will add to your attack, but 
if you pick up a weapon of a different type, it will start out back at level 1. 
It may be worth it, however, to pick up a certain type of low level weapon in exchange for a high level one. It's your call. Your goal is to simply eliminate as many opponents as you can...but we can never say anything is simple in space. Expect the unexpected....
