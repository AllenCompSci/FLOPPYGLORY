That is the ROFL copter. Just watch the video on the internet and youl understand....

Anyway, 
	
	This is the pseudocode for helicopter. You play the game by pushing the down arrow to go up. The scenery 
moves, and you sit still. We are going to be make the scenery move and cycle through. It will look like the helicopter 
is actually moving, but its kind of like the towers of hanoi program, you move the towers instead of the actual blocks.
We are going to make it generate random blocks that will act as the scenery(ceilings and walls). We will then make a
function that will generate random blocks that will be in your way as you try to high score.
	
	The helicopter will probably around the size shown. We are going to draw it using the line command around
20 times most likely. The background will be the standard black, and we are going to make the scenary blue or green.
The helicopter will probably be white. There will be a trail behind the helicopter, which will probably be red. 
	
	We are going to use if statements to check if the helicopter has hit the blocks or not. If one of the 
helicopters pixels cross one of the blocks, ceilings, or floors pixels, we will stop the program and ask if you
would like to play again.
	
	Weapons will be made available in a later version of the game. Cheat codes such as going through the walls
will also be made available.
	
	There will most likely be options as to how fast the scenery goes, for different levels and such. Score will 
be kept on a basis of one point per pixel. As I increases(pixel counter), it will cout I every few seconds, and
when the game is over, it will show a final score.
