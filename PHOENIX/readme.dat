How To Play:

To move right and left, move the mouse in the desired direction.  When shooting,
you have three choices.  Click the right mouse button to shoot from the right
side of the ship.  Click the left mouse button to shoot from the left side of
the ship.  Click both buttons to have the computer decide randomly for each
bullet.  You can score points by shooting enemies.  When you shoot an enemy,
another one will appear at the top of the screen, so don’t get lazy.  If you get
hit by an enemy’s bullet, your health meter will go down.  If your health meter
goes all the way down, you die.  You may use another life (if you have any) to
refill your health meter.

Story and Object:
 
Phoenix is a game in which you are a man who is sent on a ship to outer space to
save the world from the evil aliens that come in hopes of destroying all life on
earth in order to take over.  You know for sure that you will die in this
mission, but you also know that if it isn’t done, you’ll die anyway, so you go
to outer space in your ship, Phoenix, hoping to make the best of the situation
and to have a great time shooting the aliens down like little birds in the sky.
The object of the game is to dodge all of the enemy’s oncoming bullets and shoot
and kill them before they kill you.

FAQ:
 
Q: How do I start the game?
A: Run the Phoenix.exe file and then click play on the intro screen.
 
Q: How do I end the game?
A: Hit Escape or Esc at any time during gameplay and then click the Quit button
on the intro screen.
 
Q: What if I want to start over or messed up?
A: Simply hit Escape or Esc to go to the main menu and then click Play to start
playing a new game.
 
Q: Why is it that the enemies never run out?
A: The reason the enemies keep appearing is that there are so many enemies, that
you will never, in your life, beat them all.  In the story, there are supposed
to be so many enemies that you are ultimately doomed to die defending Earth
because of their quantity.  Since the game must remain true to the story, it is
not possible for you to beat all the enemies because you are just a human
against a huge army of millions.
