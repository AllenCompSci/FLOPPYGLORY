Iraqi's Revenge
--------------
User's Manual Text

Info.
	The game missile command orriginated in the late 80's, and was one of the first games after the well- loved Pac Man.
We in Mr. Baker's Comp. Sci. class have decided to make our own version of this game, and have dedicated hours of work time
to the making of a successful game. We hope you enjoy our version of Missile Command, dubbed Iraqi's Revenge.

System Requirements
	Hardware:
		-Computer with an 'A' drive
		-Monitor
		-Keyboard
		-Mouse
	Software:
		-C++
		-The game Iraqi's Revenge on a flopp disk
		-The correct drivers to run the game (see Mr. Baker for more info.)

Playing
Technical
	-Insert the floppy into your 'A' drive
	-Start the C++ program
	-Under file, change the directory to 'a:\'
	-Open the game file
	-Choose Run under the fun menu
	Warning: If you change any of the text used to make this game work, it will not work.
Literal
	When the game begins, you will have three choices: (1) New Game- you should choose this only if you wish to
play Iraq's Revenge; (2) Readme- This file gives a brief background, and contains troubleshooting techniques if you are 
having problems with the game; (3) Exit- this is for quiting the program at that point.

Rules
	Shoot the lasers falling towards your city before they hit and destroy the buildings. If all of your buildings are destroyed
then you get a game over. Points are awarded to the user for every laser that is stopped, and deducted for every building that is 
hit. If you allow your guns to be hit, then you recieve a penalty of having to wait until a building is destroyed, and you do lose the
subsequent points. As you progress, the lasers get faster until it isnt possible to stop them anymore. The point of the game is to 
play with a partner, and make higher scores than them.

Troubleshooting
	If for some reason the program does not run:
		-Check to make sure the correct disk is in the correct drive, specified above
		-Make sure you arent running to many other programs at once, therefore sucking up memory, and CPU capacity
	If you get strange errors while running the game, seek professional help, or throw the computer out the window in a
 	moment of really a lot anger.
