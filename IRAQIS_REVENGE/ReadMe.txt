Iraqi's Revenge
--------------

This game was created by Chris Chapman and Hendrik Schuetz in 2003. It is a
clone of Missile Command. To start the game, press (1). To read this file
press (2). To End the program, press (3). Game play is simple: click in front
of the lasers before they hit your city. Points are awarded  for every laser
hit, and they increase in speed after set amounts of time. If you are in the
middle of a game and you would like to end it, press Esc once and wait a bit.
For anything else, stick your head in the toilet.
If for some reason the program is not working, check the disk. Make sure it
is in your "a" drive, and it is the correct disk. If it isn't, then the game
will not run. But for that matter, neither would this file.
